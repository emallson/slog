# slog-rs - The Logging for [Rust][rust]

### Status & news

`slog` is an ecosystem of reusable components for structured, composable logging
for [Rust][rust].

The ambition is to be The Logging Framework for Rust. `slog` should accommodate
variety of logging features and requirements.

### Features

* flexible & easy to use
* great performance; see: [slog bench log](https://github.com/slog-rs/slog/wiki/Bench-log) and  [what makes slog fast](https://github.com/slog-rs/slog/wiki/What-makes-slog-fast)
* `#![no_std]` support (with opt-out `std` cargo feature flag)
* hierarchical loggers
* lazily evaluated values
* modular, lightweight and very extensible
	* tiny core crate that does not pull any dependencies
	* feature-crates for specific functionality
* bidirectional compatibility with standard `log` crate (`slog-stdlog` crate)
	* supports logging-scopes
	* using slog in library does not force users of the library to use slog
	  (but gives benefits); see `crates/example-lib`
* drains & output formatting
	* filtering
		* compile-time log level filter using cargo features (same as in `log` crate)
		* by level, msg, and any other meta-data
		* [`slog-envlogger`](https://github.com/slog-rs/envlogger) - port of `env_logger`
	* multiple outputs
	* efficient asynchronous logging
	* terminal output, with color support (`slog-term` crate)
	* Json (`slog-json` crate)
		* Bunyan (`slog-bunyan` crate)
	* syslog (`slog-syslog` crate)
	* first class custom drains

### Advantages over `log` crate

* **extensible** - `slog` provides core functionality, and some standard
  feature-set. But using traits, anyone can easily implement as
  powerful fully-custom features, publish separately and grow `slog` feature-set
  for everyone.
* **composable** - Wouldn't it be nice if you could use
  [`env_logger`][env_logger], but output authentication messages to syslog,
  while reporting errors over network in json format? With `slog` drains can
  reuse other drains! You can combine them together, chain, wrap - you name it.
* **context aware** - It's not just one global logger. Hierarchical
  loggers carry information about context of logging. When logging an error
  condition, you want to know which resource was being handled, on which
  instance of your service, using which source code build, talking with what
  peer, etc. In standard `log` you would have to repeat this information in
  every log statement. In `slog` it will happen automatically. See
  [slog-rs functional overview page][functional-overview] to understand better
  logger and drain hierarchies and log record flow through them.
* both **human and machine readable** - By keeping the key-value data format,
  meaning of logging data is preserved. Dump your logging to a JSON file, and
  send it to your data-mining system for further analysis. Don't parse it from
  lines of text anymore!
* **lazy evaluation** and **asynchronous IO** included. Waiting to
  finish writing logging information to disk, or spending time calculating
  data that will be thrown away at the current logging level, are sources of big
  performance waste. Use `AsyncStreamer` drain, and closures
  to make your logging fast.
* **run-time configuration** - `AtomicSwitch` drain allows
  changing logging behavior in the running program. You could use eg. signal
  handlers to change logging level or logging destinations. See
  [`signal` example][signal].

### Terminal output example

`slog-term` is only one of many `slog` features - useful showcase.

Automatic TTY detection and colors:

### Building & running

If you need to install Rust (come on, you should have done that long time ago!), use [rustup][rustup].

[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs

#### In your project

In Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
slog = "1.2"
```

In your `main.rs`:

```
#[macro_use]
extern crate slog;
```
